# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard has many employees due to retire soon and therefore needs to plan for experienced employees leaving the company, in addition to training less senior staff to prepare them to step into those roles. The purpose of this analysis was to analyze HR data (e.g. employee birth dates, hire dates, titles, etc.) to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
### Retiring Employees by Title
- A total of 90,398 employees meet Pewlett Hackard's definition of being of retirement age (i.e., born between 1952 and 1955). 
- Of that group, about 70% have "Senior," "Leader," or "Manager" in their title. That is a large % of retiring employees in leadership positions. This could mean there is opportunity to save some money by backfilling these positions with current employees who do not yet have the same level of experience as the previous title holder who likely had a higher salary due to more experience.
